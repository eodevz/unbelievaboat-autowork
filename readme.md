# Requirements
If you're not a stupid ahh person, you know how to install requirements, right?
All requirements are:
> pyautogui
> time
> datetime

If you don't know how to install them, open a new terminal in VSCode and then type this command for each requirement:
- ```pip install pyautogui```
- ```pip install time``` (i dont think you need to install time)
- ```pip install datetime``` 

Then, run it!
The coolest thing in this system is he actually logs when the action was fired
Yeah, he logs hours, minutes and even seconds of the action.
The "deposit" command already comes as true, but I really recommend you to disable it so you won't be able to be caught that easily by moderators.
Also, use it for **educational purposes**.
**DO NOT** use this on famous servers, this can actually get you banned from the server and even from Discord since they'll know that you're "selfboting".
